# Backand-1st-attempt
Sample code to connect to Backand

Based on http://jsfiddle.net/relly/ysmg1qkt/ which shows how to create a ui-grid albeit not using Backand.

Adapted the above to add Backand and cookie dependencies, and to add script references, per Backand Quickstart.

Hard codes signin (!!!) for quick testing.
